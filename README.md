# Soda Chess
Chess written in C#.  Supports all chess rules and any combination of human and AI players.

## Development
You'll need the [.NET SDK 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).  This was written using Visual Studio 2022, but Visual Studio Code can be used, too.  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

BatchChess is used to run any number of chess games against two competing AIs, and will report the results afterwards.

SodaChessConsole is the application most people will want to run; it's a command line chess program.
